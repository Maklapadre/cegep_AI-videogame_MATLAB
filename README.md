# cegep_AI-videogame_MATLAB
AI-inspired video game made with MATLAB for a CÃ©gep research project. 

This game has a bunch of :egg: falling from the sky, and you need to catch them using a :basket:. 

The eggs' falling speed increases as the game advances.

The AI elements are that if you try to anticipate the egg's falling location, the game will penalize you. 
For example, if you constantly wait in the center of the screen, the eggs will tend to drop more in the extremes.
Also, if you score really well in one round, the next one will be harder and vice versa.

The current high score is 52... Try to beat it!
