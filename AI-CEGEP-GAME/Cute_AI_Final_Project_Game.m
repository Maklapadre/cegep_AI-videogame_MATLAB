%Welcome to my Egg Simulator Game. The goal is to catch as many of the 
%falling eggs as possible. However, be weary, the speed of the eggs
%augments as time advances, making it harder and harder. Try to score as
%many points as possible, and compare the results with your friends! It's
%a simple yet addicting game, and it's great for the whole family. You can
%purchase it on the MatLab store for only 99.99$! All jokes aside, I hope
%that you will enjoy this mini-game, which has a lot of love/frustrating effort) 
%put into it :)


function varargout = Cute_AI_Final_Project_Game(varargin)
% AI_Final_Project_Game MATLAB code for AI_Final_Project_Game.fig
%      AI_Final_Project_Game, by itself, creates a new AI_Final_Project_Game or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = AI_Final_Project_Game returns the handle to a new AI_Final_Project_Game or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      AI_Final_Project_Game('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in AI_Final_Project_Game.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      AI_Final_Project_Game('Property','Value',...) creates a new AI_Final_Project_Game or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before AI_Final_Project_Game_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to AI_Final_Project_Game_OpeningFcn via varargin.

%|                 TRANSFORMING THE "LOOK" OF THE GAME                   |
%+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

%+-----------+
%|BACKGROUND |
%+-----------+
%I start by adding a background image, which is a dope little farm. I am
%defining the axes9 as the axes in question. The axes9 is a big axes that
%is as large as the figure1 (check in GUIDE to understand). I then read the
%matrix of the background image. I show it, which shows directly onto axes9.

axes(handles.axes9)         
imshow(imread('Princess_Background.jpg'));                  


%+------------+
%|FALLING EGG |
%+------------+
%For the falling egg, I start, yet again, by defining the axes in question:
%axes 2. I then call a function that I made called egg_creator. Go check
%this function to understand what it does in more precise detail. Briefly,
%it plots/fills an egg shape. The color is decided here, where you
%need to put the RGB values in the calling of the function. Here, I am
%saying that there is 1 red, 0.6 green, and 0.5 blue, making a nice pink-ish.

axes(handles.axes2)
egg_creator(1, 0.6, 0.5)


%+-----------+
%|LIFE EGGS  |
%+-----------+
%For axes5, axes7 and axes8, I do the same thing as before... I define my
%axes and then use my egg_creator function. This time, I change the color
%to a more pale, white-ish color.

axes(handles.axes5)
egg_creator(1, 0.9, 0.9)

axes(handles.axes7)
egg_creator(1, 0.9, 0.9)

axes(handles.axes8)
egg_creator(1, 0.9, 0.9)


%+-----------+
%|BASKET     |
%+-----------+
%Now, I'm creating my basket; the moving axes at the bottom of the spheres
%that needs to catch the falling egg. I'm using an uploaded image. So,
%again, I first define the axes and read the image matrix.

axes(handles.axes1)
basketMat = imread('basket.jpg');

%I'm then calling my function where I threshold a particular color. Basically, 
%I make all the white (background of the basket) from the image become 1s, 
%so white. All the other colors become 0s, so black.
basket = flipud(M04_P5_threshold_AndreKolstad('basket.jpg', 255, 255, 255, 30));

%This is deleting all the whites from my image and restoring the original
%colors in the blacks of the image. This basically transforms my basket image
%into a PNG, into an object, deleting its background.
obj_basket = image('CData', flipud(basketMat), 'AlphaData', ~basket);
axis xy
axis equal

%here, I am making my object bigger, since it used to be 600x429, which
%didn't look nice and was too small... now, it'll fit better in my GUI, at 2000x400. I'm also
%taking the axis off, so that all we see is the image itself.
obj_basket.XData = [1 2000];
obj_basket.YData = [1 400];
axis off

%| CENTER SCREEN |
%+---------------+
%This code makes the GUI pop up fully centered. This is used to make the
%whole look more esthetic. 
screenS = get(0, 'ScreenSize'); 
xPix = screenS(3);  %defining the width of the screen
yPix = screenS(4);  %defining the height of the screen

                    %HITBOX TEST
                    
                    %This is the hitbox coding. Here, the goal is for the
                    %program to understand when the basket catches the egg.
                    %To do this, I am using a "double if" structure, to
                    %check both y and x axes. Firstly, I ask if the top
                    %of the basket is at a bigger or equal position in y
                    %than the bottom of the egg. I also added the fact that
                    %the yi_egg needs to be bigger than 30 to work. This
                    %makes it so that I have a good margin of error. I
                    %couldn't simply say "yf_Basket == yi_egg", because the
                    %speed of the falling object isn't always 1, because it can be
                    %very fast, so the point where they are equal is often skipped. 
                    %Therefore, there needs to be a margin of error. I decided for 
                    %it to be of 68 pixels (62+36 is yf_basket, so -30 is 68). 
                    %Then, I ask if the left of the basket is to the left
                    %of the egg AND if the right of the basket
                    %is to the right of the egg. This gives some good
                    %conditions for the egg to be caught!
                    if yf_Basket >= yi_egg && yi_egg > 30   %if top of basket is higher than bottom of egg
                        if xi_Basket < xi_egg && xf_Basket > xf_egg     %if egg falls in x values of basket
                            score = score + 1;  %every time the egg is caught, the score goes up by 1
                            speed = speed + 0.5;  %every time the egg is caught, the speed goes up by 0.5
                            handles.text3.String = num2str(score);  %updating the score at the top right of the screen
%Pause?
                            break    %I'm breaking the while loop, making the egg start at the top once again
                        end
                    end
                    
                    %If the egg descends all the way to 0 or lower (again, the speed isn't 1, so
                    %there always needs to be a margin of error), the
                    %amount of lives is reduced by 1, and the while loop is
                    %broken, making a new egg at a new position x appear at
                    %the top.
                    if yi_egg <= 0

                        break
                    end
                end

                
                %LIFE COUNTER
                
                %Every time the egg is dropped, the life counter loses an
                %egg. There is one less life egg on the screen, replaced by
                %a blue shadow. I used a switch structure here, even though
                %I could've used an 'if' (would do the same thing).
                %By the way, I had created handles.lives earlier and defined it to 3. 
                    switch handles.lives
                        case 2      %if there are 2 lives left. After you dropped the egg once.
                            
                            %So, let me just explain what I did here. There
                            %was a problem with my function earlier,
                            %because the blue shadow of the egg was created
                            %every loop after the first time, even when the
                            %egg was caught! Since the egg-creating
                            %function is relatively big, at least for my
                            %matlab, there was a little pause every time I
                            %caught the egg. The game was a lot less
                            %smooth. So, to fix this, I figured out a way
                            %that, I agree, can be a bit unconventional, but
                            %works very well! Originally, my axes are made
                            %with '-' grid lines. So, I am saying that if
                            %their grid lines are '-', I can craft this blue
                            %shadow, and then proceed to change the grid

%I used to have a key release function, but finally didn't need it.
%However, every time I try to delete it, it says 'error'. So to fix this,
%even though it's not the most efficient thing ever, I just say that when a
%key is pressed, a = 1;. This doesn't do anything to my function nor to my
%GUI, it's just a way to satisfy matlab... so you can SKIP THIS PART, it's not important!
