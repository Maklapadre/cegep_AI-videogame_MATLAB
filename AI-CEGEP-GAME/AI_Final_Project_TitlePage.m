%Welcome to my Egg Simulator Game. The goal is to catch as many of the 
%falling eggs as possible. However, be weary, the speed of the eggs
%augments as time advances, making it harder and harder. Try to score as
%many points as possible, and compare the results with your friends! As of 
%now, the record to beat is 38 points!! It's a simple yet addicting game, 
%and it's great for the whole family. You can purchase it on the MatLab 
%store for only 99.99$! All jokes aside, I hope that you will enjoy this 
%mini-game, which has a lot of love/frustrating effort put into it :)


function varargout = AI_Final_Project_TitlePage(varargin)
% AI_Final_Project_TitlePage MATLAB code for AI_Final_Project_TitlePage.fig
%      AI_Final_Project_TitlePage, by itself, creates a new AI_Final_Project_TitlePage or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = AI_Final_Project_TitlePage returns the handle to a new AI_Final_Project_TitlePage or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      AI_Final_Project_TitlePage('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in AI_Final_Project_TitlePage.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      AI_Final_Project_TitlePage('Property','Value',...) creates a new AI_Final_Project_TitlePage or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before AI_Final_Project_TitlePage_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to AI_Final_Project_TitlePage_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
